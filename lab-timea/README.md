# 03-asynchronous-callbacks


## Description

The reader module takes an array of three file paths and resolve a mapped array of strings loaded from each file using an error-first callback. 
The string data is in the same order as the file path data (mapped). 
If an error occurs, it should immediately reject the error using the callback and stop execution.


## Built With
